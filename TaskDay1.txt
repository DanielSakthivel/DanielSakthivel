1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?
HTTP/1.1:
 For better understanding, let’s assume the situation
 when you make a request to the server for the geeksforgeeks.
 html page & server responds to you as a resource geeksforgeeks.html page. before sending the
 request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server.

 HTTP/2:
  HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. 
 HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts 
 all the messages in binary format. 
 it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.

 2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

    Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and
     forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects
      are quite different from 
      JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
       in the sense that while these primitive data-types
     all store a single value each (depending on their types).
